

This code should be able to run if we create a folder, with the 
matlab data 'CA1_data_files_Q_1_and_3' in the code folder, time lapse images,
frc1,frc2, inria1, inria2, and the M files epipole and displayEpipolar

and also put in the M files into that same folder.

Before running any of the M files, load the CA1_data_files_Q_1_and_3 matlab data file 
provided in the code folder into the workspace.

Then each M file for each question needs to be separately opened and run.
Except for Q4 if is just function file estimateF submitted and not a whole script to run.


The matlab data file contains
x y z - 3 column vectors imported from pts
xprime yprime zprime - 3 column vectors imported from ptsprime

Q3eData - a string array imported using the import paste tool,
containing the coordinates of each point to be fitted to the conic for 
question 3 part e.
