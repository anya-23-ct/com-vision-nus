
the plots are indexed by the first number in their file name from 0 to 7,
for both corresponding point plots and epipolar line plots.

The point pairs and estimated F in matlab are also indexed in the same order,
except the index 0 is just no number in the file name, and the index number is 
the last number in the name

So 1 corresponding line set is:
0_plot1_n8_frc
0_epipole_1_frc_n8
movingPoints
fixedPoints
F


Another set is:
1_plot2_n8_frc
1_epipole_2_frc_n8
movingPoints1
fixedPoints1
F1


etc.

then
2_plot1_n16_frc
2_epipole_3_frc_n16
movingPoints2
fixedPoints2
F2


and so on
