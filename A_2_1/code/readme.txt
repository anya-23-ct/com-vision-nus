For the outputs, please run the main script; 
texture_synthesis_v1 is the function called inside the main script for Qn 1,
patch_match is the function called for Qn 2

We would need all the texture samples and the 2 images "rubik" and 2 images "flower"
found under the Qn 2 folder in the main submission folder, to be in the 
same folder as the code for the code to be able to run smoothly
